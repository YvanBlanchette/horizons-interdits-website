							<b>My name is David Evanson, and I&apos;m the author of Broken Horizons.</b> This series began as a simple question that wouldn&apos;t let me go:
							what happens when exploration stops being a triumph and becomes a reckoning? Broken Horizons is my attempt to explore that space, the fragile
							moment where curiosity, science, and human limits collide.
						</p>

						<p>
							These stories are written for readers who enjoy science fiction that takes its time, that sits with uncertainty, and that treats discovery not as
							spectacle, but as consequence. If you&apos;ve chosen to step into this universe, to follow these characters beyond what feels safe or familiar,
							I&apos;m genuinely grateful. Writing is a solitary act, but reading completes it.
						</p>

						<p>
							I hope Broken Horizons gives you moments of wonder, tension, and reflection and that, when you close the page, a small part of the unknown lingers
							with you a little longer than expected.
						</p>
